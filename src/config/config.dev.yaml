  # Pure Python is not appropriate for files larger than ~50MB.
  # Files above this threshold are routed to EMR Serverless (PySpark).
  # Rationale: a 50MB .tab file can expand to 250–400MB in-memory as Python
  # dicts (3–5x raw size), making EMR the correct engine for phase3+ data.

  # Filename timestamp enforcement is OFF in dev so test files without timestamps work.
  # Set to true in prod — source systems must deliver files with a full timestamp:
  # <name>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tab  e.g. hit_data_phase1_20260225_143000.tab
  # Full timestamp (not just date) ensures uniqueness for daily, hourly, or any
  # feed frequency without needing a naming convention change later.

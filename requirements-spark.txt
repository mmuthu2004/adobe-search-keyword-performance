# These are NOT installed in the Lambda package.
# Used when:
#   1. Running spark_skp_pipeline.py locally with spark-submit
#   2. Packaging dependencies for EMR Serverless jobs
#   3. CI pipeline for parity test execution
#
# EMR 7.0.0 pre-installs: pyspark 3.5, boto3, hadoop-aws
# We only need to ship: pyyaml (our config loader dependency)

# AWS SDK — pre-installed on EMR but needed for local testing
boto3>=1.34.0

# PySpark — only for local development and parity tests
